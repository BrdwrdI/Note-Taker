# Note Taker

## Description

I decided to create this project to further my understanding of express routers and routing in general. This site was designed to help others take notes, it has a title and text field for individual notes. Working on this webpage i learned a good bit about the intricacies of using express router and became one step further towards becoming more confident with my routing.
